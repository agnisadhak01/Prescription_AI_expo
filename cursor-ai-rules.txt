  Standardized rules for Cursor AI Editor in this project. These rules automate and enforce best practices for scan quota, error handling, UI, and navigation in the Prescription app.
globs:
  - '**/*.tsx'
  - '**/*.ts'
alwaysApply: true

Always:
  - Use global context (`useAuth()`) for user scan quota (`scansRemaining`, `refreshScansRemaining`).
  - Do not use local state for scan quota unless for optimistic UI updates.
  - After any action that changes quota (scan, payment, coupon), call `refreshScansRemaining()`.
  - When a scan is processed, optimistically decrement the quota in the UI until the next refresh using a local `optimisticScans` state if needed.
  - If `scansRemaining` (or `optimisticScans`) is 0 or less, block scan actions and redirect user to the subscription page. Show an alert explaining the quota is exhausted and offer a button to purchase more scans.
  - Only check and block quota (with alert and redirect) when the user presses the scan or upload button, not on page load or passive navigation.
  - Ensure this logic is present in all user-initiated scan/upload actions.
  - All API/network/database errors must be caught and shown to the user via `Alert.alert` or a visible UI message. Log errors to the console for debugging.
  - Use the same badge and display style for scan quota across all screens. Always show the latest quota value from context.
  - For any logic that updates quota, add a comment: `// Updates scan quota using global context`.
  - For any payment/coupon logic, add a comment: `// Payment or coupon logic, refreshes scan quota`.
  - After a successful scan or payment, always refresh quota and navigate as appropriate (e.g., to home or subscription page).
  - Place all rules and automation guidelines in `cursor-ai-rules.txt` in the project root.
  - For PayU payment integration, display the payment button in a WebView modal and handle deep link redirects after payment completion.
  - When handling payment webhooks, always verify the transaction hasn't been processed already by checking the transaction_id in the payment_transactions table.
