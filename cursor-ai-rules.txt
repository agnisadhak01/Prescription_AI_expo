# Cursor AI Rules for Prescription AI Project
#
# This file serves as an index and high-level overview of the Cursor AI rules.
# The definitive and detailed rules are now structured into modular files
# within the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
#
# All rules are inherited and applied via the main index file:
# .cursor/rules/index.mdc
#
# For specific rule categories, refer to the following files:
#
# - General Principles & AI Assistant Behavior: .cursor/rules/base-rules.mdc
# - User Scan Quota Management: .cursor/rules/quota-management.mdc
# - Payment Integration (PayU): .cursor/rules/payment-integration.mdc
# - Error Handling & Logging: .cursor/rules/error-handling.mdc
# - UI/UX & Layout Consistency: .cursor/rules/ui-ux.mdc
# - App Navigation & Screen Management: .cursor/rules/navigation.mdc
# - Data Privacy & Legal Compliance: .cursor/rules/data-privacy-legal.mdc
# - Development Workflow & Build Processes: .cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc
# - In-App Notification System: .cursor/rules/notification-system.mdc
#
# Any updates to rules should be made in the respective `.mdc` files,
# and `index.mdc` should be kept up-to-date with the `extends` list.
# This file (`cursor-ai-rules.txt`) should be updated to reflect any
# changes in the `.cursor/rules/` directory structure.
