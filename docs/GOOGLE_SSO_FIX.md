# Google SSO Fix Documentation

## Problem
The app was experiencing a "DEVELOPER_ERROR" (Error Code 10) when attempting to sign in with Google. This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the app's signing fingerprint and the SHA-1 fingerprint registered in the Google Cloud Console.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Google Services Configuration
- Added the current development keystore's SHA-1 fingerprint to `google-services.json`
- Added the certificate hash to the Android config in `app.json`
- Ensured the web client ID is correctly configured in `GoogleAuthService.ts`

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced error logging throughout the Google sign-in flow
- Added detailed debugging information to identify the exact point of failure
- Improved user-facing error messages to be more helpful
- Added support for different response formats from the Google Sign-In API

### 3. Authentication Flow Updates
- Updated the GoogleAuthService to handle both data structures (direct and nested)
- Added proper type casting to avoid TypeScript errors
- Improved session management and token handling

### 4. Added Rebuild Script
Created a rebuild script (`rebuild-dev-client.bat`) to:
- Clean previous builds and caches
- Rebuild the development client with the updated configurations
- Streamline testing of the fixed version

## How to Test the Fix

1. Run the rebuild script to create a new development client:
```
.\rebuild-dev-client.bat
```

2. Install the generated APK on your device

3. Test Google Sign-In:
   - Open the app and navigate to the login screen
   - Tap the "Sign in with Google" button
   - Select your Google account
   - The app should now successfully authenticate

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If the error persists:
1. Check the logcat output for more detailed error information
2. Verify that the SHA-1 fingerprint in Google Cloud Console exactly matches the one used for signing the APK
3. Ensure that the Google Sign-In API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
4. Check that the OAuth consent screen is properly configured

### For production builds:
Remember that production builds use a different signing key, so you'll need to:
1. Get the SHA-1 fingerprint from the release keystore
2. Add it to Google Cloud Console
3. Update the `google-services.json` file accordingly

## Technical Details

The core issue was resolved by ensuring the SHA-1 fingerprint in our Google Cloud project matched the actual signing key used by the app. The current development keystore SHA-1 is:
```
AB:F1:5B:E5:66:61:96:5D:06:66:77:FE:27:CD:07:09:36:6A:01:CD
```

This was added to both the Google Cloud Console and our `google-services.json` file (in the format without colons).

Additionally, we improved the error handling and logging to make future debugging easier.
