# Google Play Store Compliance Documentation
## AI Prescription Saathi App

This document outlines the compliance implementation for the AI Prescription Saathi app to meet Google Play Store requirements.

## App Classification & Purpose

- **Category**: Health & Fitness > Organization Tool
- **Purpose**: Digital organization of prescription information
- **Non-medical disclaimer**: Not a medical device, does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment
- **Target audience**: Adults (18+) managing prescription information

## Implementation of Compliance Requirements

### Data Security & Privacy

#### Encryption Implementation
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all prescription data in the database
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Database Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase enforce user data isolation
- **Key Management**: Supabase handles secure key storage and rotation

#### Authentication Security
- **JWT Implementation**: Secure token storage with AsyncStorage and appropriate wrappers
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh with proper invalidation on logout
- **Password Requirements**: Enforced minimum complexity standards
- **Account Recovery**: Secure email verification flow for password resets

#### Technical Privacy Controls
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential prescription fields are extracted and stored
- **Identifiers**: Email/phone authentication without excessive personal identifiers
- **Data Deletion**: Cascading deletion across all tables for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Data Portability**: JSON/PDF export functionality implemented
- **Audit Logging**: All data access logged with timestamps for security monitoring

### OCR & AI Features

#### Processing Safeguards
- **Local Processing**: OCR processing occurs on-device when possible to minimize data transmission
- **Temporary Storage**: Server-side processing results purged after delivery to user device
- **Accuracy Verification**: UI prompts require users to verify extracted data with original image
- **Confidence Indicators**: Clear display of OCR confidence scores for low-confidence extractions

#### User Control
- **Manual Override**: Users can manually correct any AI-extracted information
- **Verification Step**: Required confirmation before saving prescription information
- **Transparency**: Clear indicators of AI-processed vs. user-entered information

### Permissions Implementation

- **Camera**: Runtime permissions with clear purpose explanation
- **Storage**: Minimal scope using scoped storage on Android 11+
- **Background Activity**: No background data collection implemented
- **Permission Fallbacks**: Graceful handling when permissions are denied

### Payment Integration Security

- **Gateway Security**: PayU integration with no local storage of payment information
- **Transaction Verification**: Server-side webhook validation with cryptographic signatures
- **Receipt Generation**: Automated receipts for financial regulation compliance
- **Payment Purpose**: Clear indication that payments are for scan quota credits only

### Disclaimer Implementation

- **Technical Implementation**: `DisclaimerComponent` dynamically inserts disclaimers based on screen context
- **Acknowledgment Storage**: User acceptance timestamped and stored for compliance
- **Visibility Controls**: UI constraints prevent disclaimers from being hidden or obscured
- **Version Tracking**: Legal text versioning system tracks user agreement to updated terms

### Accessibility Implementation

- **Semantic Markup**: Accessibility attributes on all UI elements for screen readers
- **Contrast Ratios**: WCAG AA compliance (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44Ã—44dp size for all interactive elements
- **Dynamic Text**: Support for system font size changes without layout breaking

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
- Unit and integration tests for privacy, security, and compliance features
- Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities in both app and server components

### Manual Review Process
- Pre-release checklist verifying all compliance requirements
- Cross-platform testing on various Android versions and device sizes
- Security assessment against OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities

### Compliance Documentation
- Complete data flow diagrams documenting prescription information lifecycle
- API security documentation with authentication and rate limiting specifications
- Comprehensive error handling procedures that prevent sensitive data exposure

## Legal Documentation

### Privacy Policy
- Explicit disclosure of all data collected, stored, and processed
- Clear explanation of user rights under GDPR and CCPA
- Detailed data retention and deletion policies
- Third-party service disclosures with processing purposes

### Terms of Service
- Clear non-medical use disclaimer
- User responsibilities for verifying prescription information
- Limitation of liability for OCR accuracy issues
- Data management and deletion rights

### Health Disclaimers
- Prominent notifications that app is not a medical device
- Explicit instructions to consult healthcare professionals
- Clear statements about information verification requirements
- Limitations of AI/OCR technology disclosed

## Regular Maintenance
