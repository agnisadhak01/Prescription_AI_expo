# Google SSO Fix - Updated

## Problem
The app was experiencing a "DEVELOPER_ERROR" (Error Code 10) when attempting to sign in with Google. This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the app's signing fingerprint and the SHA-1 fingerprint registered in the Google Cloud Console.

## Solution
We identified that the development keystore SHA-1 fingerprint wasn't properly registered in the Google Cloud Console. We have now:

1. Added the current SHA-1 fingerprint to Google Cloud Console:
   ```
   AB:F1:5B:E5:66:61:96:5D:06:66:77:FE:27:CD:07:09:36:6A:01:CD
   ```

2. Created a new OAuth client ID in Google Cloud Console:
   ```
   232795038046-h8ti1bbf9dm30t2pvpt4sfur3pss2k5p.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

3. Updated the `google-services.json` file to include this new client ID with the correct SHA-1.

4. Updated the logging in `GoogleAuthService.ts` to provide more debugging information.

## How to Test
1. Rebuild the app using the EAS cloud build:
   ```
   .\rebuild-dev-client.bat
   ```

2. Install the generated APK from the EAS dashboard.

3. Test Google Sign-In - the DEVELOPER_ERROR should now be resolved.

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the logs for error messages using `console.log` statements we've added.

2. Verify that the SHA-1 fingerprint in the Google Cloud Console exactly matches your development keystore.

3. Ensure that the `google-services.json` file is properly included in the Android build.

4. Check if you need to regenerate or update the debug keystore if it has expired.

## Future Considerations
For production builds, make sure to:

1. Register the production keystore's SHA-1 fingerprint in Google Cloud Console.

2. Update the `google-services.json` file to include both development and production fingerprints.

3. Consider using EAS build credentials management for consistent signing across different builds.
