Always:
  - Always ensure UI elements (especially header buttons) are not blocked by system overlays. For Android, add sufficient top padding to account for the status bar (use StatusBar.currentHeight).
  - When adding new UI elements, ensure minimum touch target size (at least 44x44px) for accessibility and usability.
  - When making layout changes, always test on both Android and iOS to ensure no elements are blocked by system UI overlays.
  - When fixing layout issues, first check for duplicate components, status bar configurations, and padding/margin values.
  - Avoid duplicate UI components, especially headers or status bars, that can create unnecessary whitespace or visual inconsistencies.
  - Preserve original screen layouts when making unrelated changes to prevent unintended UI regressions.
  - Never modify tab navigation layouts unnecessarily as it can affect all screens.
  - For multi-platform layouts, use Platform.OS to provide platform-specific values rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.
  - When adjusting StatusBar components, check how it affects neighboring screens and tab navigation.
  - For screens with overlapping headers or gradients, ensure z-index values are properly set to prevent visual artifacts.
  - Keep UI element measurements consistent across all screens (e.g., don't use different button sizes for the same action on different screens).
  - When refactoring status bar handling, consider moving that logic to a consistent place like navigation configuration rather than individual screens.
  - When using custom components like AppStatusBar, ensure they're only added to screens that need them to avoid layout inconsistencies.
  - Use theme-aware colors for all text elements consistently.
  - Maintain proper ScrollView padding and content container styling.
  - Follow consistent styling patterns across all legal documents.
  - Maintain proper spacing between sections (24px margin).
  - Ensure footer text is clearly visible and properly styled.
  - Add proper padding at the bottom of scrollable content.
  - Maintain consistent styling for headers, paragraphs, and footers.
  - All notification UI elements should be accessible and have proper contrast ratios.
  - Test all legal document links and contact information.
  - Verify proper display of legal text in both light and dark themes.
  - Test scrolling behavior on various screen sizes.
  - Ensure proper rendering of special characters and formatting.
  - Test accessibility of legal content (font sizes, contrast).
  - Verify proper loading of DisclaimerComponent in all contexts.
  - Test proper handling of user data deletion requests.
